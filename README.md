## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-cat using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-cat
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo cat
```

## Subgenerators
We does not recommend using those subgenerators because the most of those subgenerators use the `plugins` in `.yo-rc.json`. Use those subgenerators with `yo cat:subgenerators`.

- `cat:add`: You can use to add some template file to your project.
  - `options`
    - `item`: Choose the template which will be added to project.
    - `name`: This is the name of the output file.
  - `list`
    - react
    - reducer
    - relay
    - router
    - schema
    - jest

- `cat:mobile-app`: Use after run `create-react-native-app`.
